# Purpose of the To-Do List project 
Purpose of the project is to manage tasks using  CRUD functionality.

# Target end-user
The ideal end-user is someone who is looking to list their daily tasks into a clean and focused application with one thing in mind, organization.

# Things to be updated and Improved
I would like to add a priority level to the tasks and have the higher-priority items move higher up the listing. Also, create a bank of finished tasks that can be reviewed for accuracy when task managing (with a little self-gratification). The last thing would be configuring it with Bootstrap or Material UI to increase its usability.

# Challenges
Updating a task that had already been stated was a very difficult challenge that showed me areas I need to improve on as a developer. One of the issues I had near the end was a rouge API call that took me a little while to discover (with some help).
